The internet is the greater connection of networks between billions of computers and servers. The World Wide Web is the pages that we access and communicate through while using the internet.
The internet works by transmitting messages that are broken down into "Packets." These packets are sent to a designated location on a server or another computer using a link (ethernet, wifi, Bluetooth.) The router's job is to make sure the message gets to the desired location where information can be received, reassembled, stored and displayed for others to see and access.
A directory is a location where files are stored on your computer. Basically it is a folder that can hold subfolders and files within each folder. Directories are sorted by "grandparent, parent and child" leading down to the folder that holds the file you are looking for.
VCS or Version Control Systems track and manage actions that happen to a file system. It allows you to go back and look at previous iterations of projects you were working on and also allows for collaboration. I know I will benefit from being able to backtrack and work from a previous version when something doesn't go right.  It will also be useful in the future working on collaborative projects

It is really difficult to say what my favorite kind of art is. I really enjoy digital illustration, painting and ceramics. I also really enjoy looking at other peoples digital art and paintings especially those that are of far away landscapes, locations either real or fantastical because I like imagining myself in alternative worlds.

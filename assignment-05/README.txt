1. I looked at Youtube from 2005. It looks signifigantly different and had the headings of a creepy dating site. It says " I am male seaking everyone between 18-45." 
I've never filtered content in this way so its really weird to see that was what it did in the beginning. Especially since Youtube has never seemed like a location for pornography conent but rather lighthearted videos. 
2. I am getting a sort of refresher on what tags work in coding HTML. It is coming back slowly but I was very excited to see everything work on the Index and about pages

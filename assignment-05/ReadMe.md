1. I looked at Youtube from 2005. It looks signifagantly different and had the headings of a creepy dating site. It says " I am male seeking everyone between 18-45."
I've never filtered content in this way so its really weird to see that was what it did in the beginning. Especially since Youtube has never seemed like a location for pornography conent but rather lighthearted videos.
2. I am getting a sort of refresher on what tags work in coding HTML. It is coming back slowly but I was very excited to see everything work on the Index and about pages. I also Figured out how to work Github desktop and got much better at atom which is exciting.

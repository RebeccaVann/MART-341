    <p>My dad used to read me the magic tree house books before I would go to bed at night. I remember the excitement of when the treehouse began to spin and shake taking teh charcters off to a new time and place. I think its likley that this inspored my love for fantasy books as I got older. To this day I wish I could open a book and point to it and be taken where ever it is set.

13. html docs only have two main document elements the head and the body.
The Head tag is typically used to import other files and define attributes of your page that are not displayed, like meta data.
The body tag is where you you place the parts of your website that you want displayed, like p tags, headers, divs, etc.

14. Structural markup is the markup that structures the page layout. Semantic markup is markup where the name of the tag indicates something about the content.

15. For this assignment I went through all the parts of the homework website. Picked out the recipe for my favorite food and laid out all of the different headers or elements I needed. I then filled out those sections with the necessary information refreshing my webpage when I added a new section.

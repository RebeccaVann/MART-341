1. I run into lots of file submission forums for classes, I am currently applying for internships so I see lots of imput text and calendar forums. Also one I haven't seen on HTML but official signature forums to agree to something.
2. Text imputs could be used for passwords, typing in a name, comments or questions and allow you to give lots of information in a forum
selection imputs let you choose one or more options it could be for a survey or test or  agree or disagree to something
button imputs can let you submit things or link to other pages
3. This week I relied a lot on the overview video and worked through my document at the same time as the video after I had read through the different sections on the website. I did this because I needed a refresher after reading through everything. I think I understand how everything works but don't remember all the logistics and had to reference w3 a couple of times.

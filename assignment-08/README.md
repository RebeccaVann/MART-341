Span is used for small chunk and div uses a large chunk of the HTML codes. Div tag is most used for HTML in web development because it helps to separate out data on web pages. Span is for a small inline edit.
Youtube or Vimeo are nice for housing files that are too big to keep on your compurter and upload at a fast enough speed for the browser. This material can easily be stolen and used and is not idea for images. 
This week I could not get information to show up after the video div. I have no idea why and i could see the content in preview but not on the web. I ended up putting it last on the page but was not what I was trying to do for quite some time.

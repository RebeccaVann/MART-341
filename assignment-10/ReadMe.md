1. A class selector is a name with a full stop (“.”)It is more suited for editing more than one part of a webpage. The ID tag starts with a # and refers to a specific element called out on a page. It can only be called on once. Universal selectors dont use a sybol to be called upon but have h1 or p tags refering to the html document alowing for more than one part with the same descripter to be changed. 

2. The colors I chose were based on the posters from the 1920s that had lots of gold, black white and other royal looking colors. I used black, #e6b400 and day gold and #fffce0 and lighter yellow

3. This week I defintaly put off this assignment untill too late and then was having fun editing lots of things and so I spent more time than expected on it. This is not a bad thing because it is excitin that I am now able to design pages not just make them.

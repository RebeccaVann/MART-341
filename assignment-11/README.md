1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? A desktop font is made to be installed on your computer for use with applications. Most desktop font files will download as a .zip file, and end in tff or otf. A webfont is a specially tuned font for use on websites using the CSS @font-face declaration.Web safe fonts are remembered by scc and no additional information in necessary to uload or link the font. 
3. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack? IN case a font doesn't work the text will still appear and not look terrible
4. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you did to overcome them. Github desktop had a lot of issues this week. my files dicappeared and I cant clone them from the website version.

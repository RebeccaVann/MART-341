          “The words he had written wiggled off the page and escaped from the drawer. The letters stacked themselves,
          one on top of the other. Their towers reached higher and higher until they stood majestic and tall,
          surrounding Neftali in a city of promise. HUMANITY. SOLIDARITY. GENEROSITY. PEACE. JUSTICE. LOVE.
          Then a tiny, conceited word came along. Like a hungry termite, it began to gnaw on the tall words,
          chewing at their foundation, gulping their pulp until they swayed, toppled, and collapsed.
           All that remained was one fat, satisfied syllable. FEAR.”

          surrounding the dreamer,<br>
          Ever present,<br>
          I capture the spirit,<br>
          enslave<br>
          the reluctant pen,<br>
          and become<br>
          the breath<br>
          on the writer's only road.”<br>

          “Although he had changed his name, his history came with him, even to his writing.
          The rhythm of his rain-soaked childhood became a sequence of words. His memories of the
          understory of the great forest burst into lyrical phrases, as resinous as the sap of a pinecone,
          as crisp as the shell of a beetle. Sentences grew long, then pulled up short, taking on the tempo
          of the waves upon the shore, or swayed gently, like the plaintive song of a lone harmonica. His fury
          became essays that pointed, stabbed, and burned. His convictions played out with the monotonous
          determination of a printing press. And his affections became poems, as warm and supple as the wool of
          a well-loved sheep.” <br>

          “Pablo Neruda's poems tramped through the mud [with the fieldworker]...knocked at the doors of
          mansions...sat at the table of the baker...The shopkeeper leaned over his counter and read them to his
           customers and said "Do you know him? He is my brother."
<br>
           The poems became books that people passed from hand to hand. The books traveled over fences...
           nd bridges... and across borders... soaring from continent to continent... until he had passed thousands of
           gifts through a hole in the fence to a multitude of people in every corner of the world.”

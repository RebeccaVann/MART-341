       The idea of marrying yoga and goats came about in what Morse calls “a series of serendipity moments” that followed some not so pleasant ones. She got divorced, and then she was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. “I was super depressed,” she says.
       <br>
       <br>
       Morse found solace on the farm: “I would go out every day and spend time with my goats.” She dubbed that special time “Goat Happy Hour,” and she began inviting people over.
       <br>
       <br>
       You never know what it means when something goes viral, but it feels like a roller coaster going 100 miles an hour, and you can't get off, Morse said.

       Morse’s friends found the goats a stress reliever. One guest was a yoga instructor.

       “We’re standing out in my field, and it’s just beautiful with the mountain views, and the goats all standing around us,” she says. The friend told her they should have a yoga class there.
       <br>
       <br>
       Morse replied, ”’Okay, but the goats are going to be all over the humans.” The friend’s reaction? “Cool.”
       <br>
       <br>
       Lainey Morse had been working in marketing, so she used her PR skills and took some photos of that first goat yoga class, sending them to Modern Farmer.
       <br>
       <br>
       “Within a few minutes, they contacted me and said, ‘We have got to do a story on this.’” The story came out and changed her life. “You never know what it means when something goes viral, but it feels like a roller coaster going 100 miles an hour, and you can’t get off.”
       <br>
       <br>
       By the time Morse had the business fully up and running, “I had over 2,300 people on the wait list.” She started listing classes on Facebook, and “realized I can’t have 400 people on my farm showing up for goat yoga.” She soon came up with a registration platform to bring order to the process.

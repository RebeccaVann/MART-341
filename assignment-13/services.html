    <h2>The Goats</h2>

              People have come from as far as Japan and Australia for Morse’s classes just to meet the goats.
<br> <br>

              Morse owns Nigerian Dwarf goats, miniature animals which max out at 30-40 pounds. Sometimes she will entice the youngest goats to get involved by putting treats on a customer’s back or belly, and when the goats get too big to jump, they merely trot around the class or sit nearby. As for upkeep: “Dogs are much more expensive than goats.”
<br> <br>
              Classes are now held at three locations in Oregon, and Morse has brought in partners who can provide farm property and more goats. She usually limits class sizes to 30 to keep a good human-to-goat ratio. She’s also making money licensing out the “Original Goat Yoga” name and logo to farms in four other states, including New York. Launch classes in these new locations have sold out.
<br> <br>
              Oregon State researchers are working with her about goat-human interaction, and Michigan State has started offering goat yoga classes through its urban farm program. Morse has done corporate events for Nike and Kaiser Permanente, and she is looking for property to open a “Goat-el,” where people can stay for the entire goat experience.
<br> <br>
              But what Lainey Morse enjoys most of all, besides spending time with her goats, is seeing how happy they make other people.
<br> <br>
              “I remember a lady coming. She says, ‘I almost didn’t come. I bought my tickets awhile ago and my husband was diagnosed with cancer, and I’ve been his caregiver and it’s been so hard on me.’” The woman had planned to cancel her goat yoga session, but her daughter talked her out of it. “It’s been the best decision I could’ve made, because it’s the first time I’ve smiled in months,” she told Morse.
<br> <br>
              Recalling the story, Lainey Morse pauses for a moment. “That’s powerful.”

1. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
my imaginary client is a goat yoga studio reporting on this new and strange trend.
2. Why is it important to consider a mobile-first design?
With most web browsing done on mobile phones rather than computers it is important to be able to navigate through a page or you will loose clients
3. Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how you overcame them.
This week my only issues were forgetting a back slash and not being able to figure out why my page wasn't working correctly. I also had no idea what to make a website about but am quite happy with it.

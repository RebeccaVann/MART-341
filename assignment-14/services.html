    <h2>The Goats</h2>

    <p>The secret is out.
    Goats are not stupid. They’re not mean. They don’t even stink. They’re actually intelligent, friendly, and soft.

    At least that’s the case with the baby goats which jump on the backs of paying customers attending Original Goat Yoga classes in Corvallis, Oregon.
    <br> <br>
    Downward Dog, meet upright goat. People actually pay $35 to do yoga in a barn with goats.


    It’s surprisingly relaxing to feel a couple of small animals jump up onto your back while you’re trying to maintain something difficult, like a plank position. The little goats’ hooves provide a bit of a massage as they move to keep their balance. It makes you giggle, and it certainly takes your mind off the yoga.

    “I never lived in a spot where I could have goats,” says owner Lainey Morse. “I wanted them my whole life.”

    So a few years ago she bought some property, purchased a copy of “Raising Goats for Dummies” (a real book), and took possession of her first two goats. She now has a small herd.

    <br> <br>
    But goat yoga? Really?
    <br>
    <br>
    In her first year of business, 2016, Morse made $160,000 in revenue. This year she expects to double that figure and finally be profitable. Moving the business into the black took longer than this 46-year-old accidental entrepreneur expected.
    <br>
    “I just didn’t think it would be six figures in expenses,” she says. More on that in a moment.</div>

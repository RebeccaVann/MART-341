1. What library did you choose?
I used UI kit because I saw that it connects with adobe xd which I'd like to learn
2. Did you use a local file or CDN? Why?
I used CDN mostly because there were 5 local files and it only wokred when I liked them all but I still didn't get the nav bar to work.
3. How does HTML5 change the web?
HTML5 allows for more interactive elements, has simpler plugins which makes everything more simplified, it more easily accesses local files and may be more secure
4. Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how
you overcame them.
this week I started with bulma but didn't see too many free examples online of what was possible. That took up a lot of time but
its not waisted if I learn more about these plugins later!
